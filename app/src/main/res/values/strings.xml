    <string name="briefing1">In this mission you will be expected to pick the exact time and date for a launch of the Saturn V rocket that will put it in orbit around the moon.
    Assume that the moon has an orbit of exactly 27 days and that at midnight 00:00 it is directly over the launch site.
        You will need to launch at a time that will put you in the vicinity of the moon 51 hours and 49 minutes later.
    Can you do it?
    Don\'t think too hard; it\'s only rocket science.</string>
