    <string name="briefing1">\t It is October 2029, the Saturn V rocket is being recommissioned to go to the moon, once again. You are a lowly Neo-NASA tech, and you have to make decisions about the launch,
        because your bosses are just to lazy. Typical.\n\n
        In this mission you will be expected to pick the exact time and date for a launch of the Saturn V rocket that will put it in orbit around the moon, next month.\n\n
    Assume that the moon has an orbit of exactly 27 days and that at midnight 00:00 on the first of November it will be directly over the launch site.
        You will need to launch at a time that will put you in the vicinity of the moon 51 hours and 49 minutes after the launch.\n\n
        Can you do it? Don\'t think too hard; it\'s only rocket science.</string>
